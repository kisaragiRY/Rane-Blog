Mathematics is behind all the recent breakthroughs. It’s the reason we can push technology forward every year. We use mathematics even though we might not be aware of it. That’s the reason why everyone should have a basic understanding of how maths really comes into play in a modern world. The following list of books will allow you to get a sense of that without having to get technical details and complicated proofs.

```java
return (
    <div className='post-wrapper'>
        {/* {console.log(blog_id_to_blog(blogs,file_name)[0].title)} */}
        <h1>{blog.title}</h1>
        <Latex block={true} values={string}/>
        <Markdown 
            className='markdown'
            children={post} 
            options={{
                overrides:{
                    Latex:{
                        component:Latex,
                    },
            }
            }}/>
    </div>
  )
}
```

<Latex block={false} 
       values='$$\sum_{s=4}^n x_i$$'/>
